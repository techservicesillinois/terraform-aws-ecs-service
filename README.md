# ecs-service

[![Terraform actions status](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-ecs-service/workflows/terraform/badge.svg)](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-ecs-service/actions)

Provides an ECS service - effectively a task that is expected to
run until an error occurs or a user terminates it (typically a
webserver or a database). This module's primary intent is to make
it easier to set up a load balanced service using an existing
[Application Load
Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).
If using a load balancer the module will automatically create a
[listener rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-update-rules.html),
a [target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html),
and [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html)
when in `awsvpc` mode.
In addition, the module will automatically create a task definition
if one is not supplied. This module does **not** support Amazon's
[Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html)
or
[Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html).

See the [ECS Services section in Amazon's ECS developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).

Example Usage
-----------------

### The containers.json file

For an ECS service that does *not* use an existing task definition, the
set of containers that will comprise the service must be specified
in the `container_definition_file` argument. This file is named
`containers.json` by default, and must be a valid JSON document.

Please note that this example contains only a small subset of the
available parameters. For further information, see
`container_definition_file` argument in the [Task
definition](#task_definition) block.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "apache",
    "image": "httpd",
    "portMappings": [
      {
        "containerPort": 80
      }
    ]
  }
]

> is `aws_vpc`.
>

A `docker_volume_configuration` block appears within a [`volume`](#volume) block, and supports the following:

* `scope` - (Optional) The scope for the Docker volume, which determines its lifecycle, either task or shared. Docker volumes that are scoped to a task are automatically provisioned when the task starts and destroyed when the task stops. Docker volumes that are scoped as shared persist after the task stops.

* `autoprovision` - (Optional) If this value is true, the Docker volume is created if it does not already exist. Note: This field is only used if the scope is shared.

* `driver_opts` - (Optional) A map of Docker driver specific options.

* `labels - (Optional) A map of custom metadata to add to your Docker volume.
